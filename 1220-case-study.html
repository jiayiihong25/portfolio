            <h2 class="section-title">Context</h2>
            <p>The 1220/1299E Ivey Business Foundations Case Competition is the largest first year case competition at
                Western University with over 400 student participants.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">The Challenge</h2>
            <p>Kelvin Van Rijn, the founder of The Fritter Shop, had successfully relocated his business to London,
                Ontario. He had captured the local market with his authentic Dutch fritters, but his growth had hit a
                ceiling. He faced a common founder’s dilemma: he wanted to expand across Ontario, but he was constrained
                by his own time and capital.</p>
            <p>Our task was to determine the optimal growth strategy to scale the business without diluting the brand’s
                quality or burning out Kelvin.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Understanding the "Why"</h2>
            <p>Through looking at the consumer experience, we identified 3 key ideas that shaped our solution.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Sensory Experience:</strong> Throughout the customer journey, The Fritter Shop provided
                    comfort and nostalgia both through smell and taste. The warmth of the pastry shop paired with the
                    fresh scent of fritters were essential to their value proposition. Therefore a CPG licensing
                    strategy wouldn’t work here as it removes the magic of the sensory experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Founder Bottleneck:</strong> Kelvin was central to the operation because he ensured the
                    authentic taste of fritters and completed quality assurance. A quick expansion strategy would
                    require him to manage multiple locations personally which would likely increase the risk of burnout.
                    Therefore we had to figure out a way to decentralize operations while maintaining his standards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Value of Local Ownership:</strong> The brand’s success was rooted in its feel as a
                    "local gem." We determined that a franchisee invested in their specific community would be better
                    positioned to replicate this authenticity than a distant corporate manager.
                </li>
            </ul>

        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">The Solution</h2>
            <p>We proposed a Phased Franchise Model that prioritized control and quality assurance over rapid growth.
                The implementation plan was broken down into five distinct phases to ensure the business foundation was
                solid before scaling.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Phase 1: Foundation & Vetting (Months 0-5):</strong> We focused heavily on "Franchise
                    Marketing" and rigorous screening. The goal was to find a partner who matched our "Franchisee
                    Persona" rather than just the first investor with capital. We conducted background checks and
                    financial reviews to ensure alignment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Phase 2: The Build (Months 5-7):</strong> This phase involved site selection and
                    construction. We targeted Waterloo for the pilot location due to its demographic similarity to
                    London.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Phase 3: Knowledge Transfer (Months 7-9):</strong> Before opening, we implemented
                    comprehensive staff training. This standardized Kelvin's tacit knowledge into a replicable training
                    manual to ensure product consistency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Phase 4: The Support Loop (Month 10+):</strong> Post-launch, we instituted a system of
                    monthly performance reviews and check-ins. This created a feedback loop where Kelvin could offer
                    operational support directly, mitigating the risk of quality slippage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Phase 5: Future Expansion:</strong> With the pilot stabilized and the playbook proven, the
                    roadmap targeted Toronto and Oakville to penetrate high-density markets using the cash flow and
                    reputation built in Waterloo.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Lessons Learnt</h2>
            <p><strong>Back data with concrete research:</strong> A major part of our strategy was our implementation
                plan and what set it apart was the focus on the nitty gritty details that were well researched. When we
                pitched our franchising idea, we didn’t just pitch what cities to expand to, we pitched exact addresses
                of storefronts up for sale, exact costs of renovations and acquisition and ultimately showed how
                feasible our solution actually was.</p>
            <p><strong>Tell a story:</strong> We used a narrative hook involving tired parents finding the shop to sell
                our strategy to the judges. I learned that while data justifies the decision, empathy sells it.
                Grounding the business problem in a relatable human moment, especially during our final presentation in
                front of hundreds of audience members really pushed the solution home.</p>
