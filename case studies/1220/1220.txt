The Fritter Shop: Scaling a Local Favorite through Strategic Franchising
Context
The 1220/1299E Ivey Business Foundations Case Competition is the largest first year case competition at Western University with over 400 student participants.
The Challenge 
Kelvin Van Rijn, the founder of The Fritter Shop, had successfully relocated his business to London, Ontario. He had captured the local market with his authentic Dutch fritters, but his growth had hit a ceiling. He faced a common founder’s dilemma: he wanted to expand across Ontario, but he was constrained by his own time and capital.
Our task was to determine the optimal growth strategy to scale the business without diluting the brand’s quality or burning out Kelvin. 
Understanding the "Why"
Through looking at the consumer experience, we identified 3 key ideas that shaped our solution. 
The Sensory Experience: Throughout the customer journey, The Fritter Shop provided comfort and nostalgia both through smell and taste. The warmth of the pastry shop paired with the fresh scent of fritters were essential to their value proposition. Therefore a CPG licensing strategy wouldn’t work here as it removes the magic of the sensory experience. 
The Founder Bottleneck: Kelvin was central to the operation because he ensured the authentic taste of fritters and completed quality assurance. A quick expansion strategy would require him to manage multiple locations personally which would likely increase the risk of burnout. Therefore we had to figure out a way to decentralize operations while maintaining his standards. 
The Value of Local Ownership: The brand’s success was rooted in its feel as a "local gem." We determined that a franchisee invested in their specific community would be better positioned to replicate this authenticity than a distant corporate manager.
The Solution
We proposed a Phased Franchise Model that prioritized control and quality assurance over rapid growth. The implementation plan was broken down into five distinct phases to ensure the business foundation was solid before scaling.
Phase 1: Foundation & Vetting (Months 0-5): We focused heavily on "Franchise Marketing" and rigorous screening. The goal was to find a partner who matched our "Franchisee Persona" rather than just the first investor with capital. We conducted background checks and financial reviews to ensure alignment.
Phase 2: The Build (Months 5-7): This phase involved site selection and construction. We targeted Waterloo for the pilot location due to its demographic similarity to London.
Phase 3: Knowledge Transfer (Months 7-9): Before opening, we implemented comprehensive staff training. This standardized Kelvin's tacit knowledge into a replicable training manual to ensure product consistency.
Phase 4: The Support Loop (Month 10+): Post-launch, we instituted a system of monthly performance reviews and check-ins. This created a feedback loop where Kelvin could offer operational support directly, mitigating the risk of quality slippage.
Phase 5: Future Expansion: With the pilot stabilized and the playbook proven, the roadmap targeted Toronto and Oakville to penetrate high-density markets using the cash flow and reputation built in Waterloo.
Lessons Learnt
Back data with concrete research: A major part of our strategy was our implementation plan and what set it apart was the focus on the nitty gritty details that were well researched. When we pitched our franchising idea, we didn’t just pitch what cities to expand to, we pitched exact addresses of storefronts up for sale, exact costs of renovations and acquisition and ultimately showed how feasible our solution actually was. 
Tell a story: We used a narrative hook involving tired parents finding the shop to sell our strategy to the judges. I learned that while data justifies the decision, empathy sells it. Grounding the business problem in a relatable human moment, especially during our final presentation in front of hundreds of audience members really pushed the solution home.
