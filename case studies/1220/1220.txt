The Fritter Shop: Scaling a Local Favorite through Strategic Franchising
Context
The 1220/1299E Ivey Business Foundations Case Competition is the largest first year case competition at Western University with over 400 student participants.
The Challenge 
Kelvin Van Rijn, the founder of The Fritter Shop, had successfully relocated his business to London, Ontario. He had captured the local market with his authentic Dutch fritters, but his growth had hit a ceiling. He faced a common founder’s dilemma: he wanted to expand across Ontario, but he was constrained by his own time and capital.
Our task was to determine the optimal growth strategy to scale the business without diluting the brand’s quality or burning out the founder.
Understanding the "Why"
To crack this case, we looked closely at the consumer experience and the operational reality of the business to guide our strategy.
1. The Sensory Experience: We analyzed the customer journey and realized that The Fritter Shop sold comfort and nostalgia alongside their pastries. The smell of the fritters and the warmth of the shop were essential to the value proposition. This insight steered us away from a CPG licensing strategy, as putting frozen fritters in grocery stores would strip away the sensory magic that drove sales.
2. The Founder Bottleneck: Kelvin was central to the operation, which became a limiting factor for growth. A corporate expansion strategy would require him to manage multiple locations personally, which significantly increased the risk of burnout. We needed a model that would decentralize operations while maintaining his high standards.
3. The Value of Local Ownership: The brand’s success was rooted in its feel as a "local gem." We determined that a franchisee invested in their specific community would be better positioned to replicate this authenticity than a distant corporate manager.
The Solution
We proposed a Phased Franchise Model as the winning strategy. This approach leveraged the capital and drive of local entrepreneurs to fuel expansion while keeping Kelvin focused on product innovation and brand standards.
* Phase 1: The Pilot: Instead of aggressive expansion, we prioritized establishing one flagship franchise location first. This acted as a proof of concept to refine the training manual and supply chain before scaling further.
* Risk Mitigation: We built in rigorous monthly performance reviews and direct operational support lines to Kelvin. This directly addressed the risk of quality slippage, which was a major concern given a previous failed partnership in the brand's history.
Lessons Learnt
History repeats itself if you let it: A major part of our strategy involved analyzing why a previous partnership failed for the business. I learned that proposing a strategy like franchising requires building safety rails, such as strict vetting and QA checks, to prevent past mistakes from recurring. Strategy is as much about risk management as it is about growth.
The power of storytelling: We used a narrative hook involving tired parents finding the shop to sell our strategy to the judges. I learned that while data justifies the decision, empathy sells it. Grounding the business problem in a relatable human moment, especially during our final presentation in front of hundreds of spectators truly made the solution feel inevitable.
